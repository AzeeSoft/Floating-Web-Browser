# Floating Web Browser
**Floating Web Browser** is a simple Web Browser built on top of **Chromium**, which **can be minimized into a small floating icon** on the screen that can be moved around, and upon clicking, it expands into a complete web browser. The tool is aimed to **improve productivity**.

- I developed this app using **JavaFX** on top of the **JCEF (Chromium) library** in **2016**. The biggest challenge was to get the chromium working with JavaFX (without crashes!).
    - **Languages Used:** Java, CSS
    - **Platforms/Libraries:** JavaFX, JCEF, Git
